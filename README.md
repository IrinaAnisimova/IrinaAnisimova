I am an active and responsible team player, looking to start my career in software development. I am sure my abilities, desire to further my skills in the field, and my previous work experience in a variety of fields would make me a valuable addition to your team.
With a completed PhD in Sociology and experience in social and vocational development research fields, I decided to transition into a career in the tech space. As a result, I enrolled in a Software Engineering course at HyperionDev.
During my course I learnt Python and SQL. I created over 30 programs in these languages. I also performed tasks involving problem solving and complex mathematics such as k-means algorithms. I completed my course with a 92% average.
My work experience and education required working under tight deadlines and thinking creatively. I believe my experience has demonstrated my skills in data collection, management and processing, as well as in communication.
I am keen to learn more about software development and gain new skills and abilities while building upon the skills and abilities which I possess.
